If a theme has been developed for use with this plugin, theme options will be enabled on install.

== Description ==

The Options Framework Plugin is designed to help theme developers easily add options to their projects.

Please visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin) for a full description of how to define and use the theme options.

The code is heavily based on the [WooFramework](http://www.woothemes.com/2010/02/canvas/) and their option styles.

== Installation ==

Upload the Options Framework to your site.  If your theme already has options enabled, they will show up under the apperance menu.  If your theme doesn't have options, you can define them to options.php of your theme and they will instantly show up.  For more on how to do this, visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).
