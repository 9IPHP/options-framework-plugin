The Options Framework helps to easily enables options in your themes.

== Description ==

The Options Framework Plugin is designed to help theme developers easily add options to their projects.  Right now it's in a really rough form, but in the coming weeks it should be fleshed out and added to the WordPress plugin repository.

Please visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin) for a full description of how to define and use the theme options.

The code is heavily based on the [WooFramework](http://www.woothemes.com/2010/02/canvas/) and their option styles.

== Installation ==

Upload the Options Framework to your site.  If your theme already has options enabled, they will show up under the apperance menu.  If your theme doesn't have options, you can define them to options.php of your theme and they will instantly show up.  For more on how to do this, visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).
